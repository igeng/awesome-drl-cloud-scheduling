## Introduction

With the increasing complexity of cloud environments and the dynamic nature of workloads, traditional scheduling algorithms often fall short in optimizing resource allocation. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising approach by learning optimal scheduling policies through environment interaction.

This repository collects significant works and tools that leverage DRL for:
- **Resource scheduling / placement**
- **Service autoscaling** (microservice scaling-in / scaling-out)
- **Cloud‑level scheduling decisions**
